On Earth , 96.5 % of the planet 's crust water is found in seas and oceans , 1.7 % in groundwater , 1.7 % in glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland , a small fraction in other large water bodies , and 0.001 % in the air as vapor , clouds -LRB- formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air -RRB- , and precipitation . Water vapor , water vapour or aqueous vapor is the gaseous phase of water . Clouds consist of microscopic droplets of liquid water -LRB- warm clouds -RRB- , tiny crystals of ice -LRB- cold clouds -RRB- , or both -LRB- mixed phase clouds -RRB- . Cloud droplets initially form by the condensation of water vapor onto condensation nuclei when the supersaturation of air exceeds a critical value according to Köhler theory . Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance , that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure ; but it often refers also to its solid state -LRB- ice -RRB- or its gaseous state -LRB- steam or water vapor -RRB- .
Less than 0.3 % of all freshwater is in rivers , lakes , and the atmosphere , and an even smaller amount of the Earth 's freshwater -LRB- 0.003 % -RRB- is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products . In physics a vapor -LRB- American -RRB- or vapour -LRB- British -RRB- is a substance in the gas phase at a temperature lower than its critical temperature , which means that the vapor can be condensed to a liquid by increasing the pressure on it without reducing the temperature .
